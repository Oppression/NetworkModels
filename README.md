# O3 (Object Oriented Oppression) 

### Summary 
Object Oriented Oppression (O3) reveals the conceptual clustering of socio-political categorization, and challenges social hackers to identify vulnerabilities in the social “code” of oppression. This hands-on installation hijacks the paradigm of object-oriented programming to describe and enable the disruption of systems of oppression.

This project is a collaboration between myself, Ray Gilstrap, and Pia Zargoza, and was inspired by Yerba Buena Center for Arts' civic question, "Can we design freedom?"
