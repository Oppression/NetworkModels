### Summary 
Object Oriented Oppression (O3) is a research and civic hacking project that challenges citizens to identify vulnerabilities in the social “code” of oppression. This project was initiated by Siobhán K Cronin, Ray Gilstrap, and Pia Zargoza, who met during Yerba Buena Center for Arts' innaugral fellowship program. 

This repository of network models provides templates for visualizing systemic oppression implemented in Python and D3.js.
